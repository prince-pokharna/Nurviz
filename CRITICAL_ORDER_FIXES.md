## ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** 🟢 FIXED & DEPLOYED  

---

## 🐛 ISSUES FOUND & FIXED

### **1. ✅ Orders Not Saving to Database**

**Problem:**
- Orders only saved to local JSON file (doesn't work on Vercel)
- Not saved to Firebase
- Orders disappeared after deployment

**Fix:**
- ✅ Created `/api/orders/save-firebase` route
- ✅ Saves orders to Firebase Firestore
- ✅ Works on Vercel serverless environment
- ✅ Created `/api/orders/get` to fetch from Firebase
- ✅ Orders now persist permanently

**Files Changed:**
- `app/api/orders/save-firebase/route.ts` (NEW)
- `app/api/orders/get/route.ts` (NEW)
- `app/checkout/page.tsx` (updated to use Firebase save)

---

### **2. ✅ Book1.xlsx Not Updating**

**Problem:**
- Excel generation only works on local filesystem
- Vercel can't write to files
- Book1.xlsx not updated after orders

**Fix:**
- ✅ Orders now save to Firebase (queryable for Excel)
- ✅ Excel generation triggers async (doesn't block orders)
- ✅ Admin can manually generate via `/admin/order-book`

**Note:** Excel generation works locally. On Vercel, use Firebase data to download orders.

---

### **3. ✅ Orders Not Showing in Customer History**

- Order history page tried to read from local JSON
- Couldn't find orders on Vercel

**Fix:**
- ✅ Created Firebase orders API

**Files Changed:**
- `app/checkout/page.tsx`

---

### **6. ✅ Shipping Updated to Flat ₹90**

## 💳 RAZORPAY PAYMENT ISSUE

### **Why Customer Paid But You Didn't Receive:**

**Most Likely Reason:**

You're using **TEST MODE** credentials:
- `rzp_test_xxxxx` = Test mode (fake money)
- Customers can "pay" but no real money transfers
- Good for testing, not for real sales

**Solution:**

### **Switch to LIVE MODE:**

1. **Complete Razorpay KYC:**
   - https://dashboard.razorpay.com/app/kyc
   - Submit business documents
   - Wait for approval (1-2 days)

2. **Generate LIVE Keys:**
   - Dashboard → Settings → API Keys
   - Toggle to **"Live Mode"**
   - Generate live keys
   - Keys start with `rzp_live_`

3. **Update Vercel Environment Variables:**
   - Replace `rzp_test_` with `rzp_live_`
   - Update all 3 variables
   - Redeploy

4. **Now customers pay REAL money!**

### **Go to Firebase Console:**

1. https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select: "nurvi-jewel"
3. Firestore Database → Rules
4. **Add this rule:**

```javascript
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Products - allow all
    match /products/{productId} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
    
    // Orders - allow reads and creates
    match /orders/{orderId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if true;
      allow update: if true;
    }
    
    // Everything else
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click **"Publish"**

**Without this, orders won't save!**

## 💰 ABOUT THE LOST ORDER

### **Why Customer Didn't Pay Real Money:**

**Most Likely Reason:**

You're using **Razorpay TEST mode** (`rzp_test_`):
- ✅ Payment popup works
- ✅ Customer sees success
- ❌ **No real money transfers**
- ❌ It's a simulation for testing

**Test Mode =** Fake payments for testing  
**Live Mode =** Real payments with real money

### **What Happened:**
1. Customer "paid" using test mode
2. Razorpay simulated success
3. No real money was charged
4. You received no funds (because it was test mode)

### **Solution for Real Payments:**

Switch to **Live Mode**:
1. Complete KYC on Razorpay
2. Generate live keys (`rzp_live_`)
3. Update Vercel variables
4. Real money will transfer!
